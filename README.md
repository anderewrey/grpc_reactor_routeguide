# gRPC Reactor Callbacks, client-side implementation

Complete redesign of the [gRPC route_guide][grpc-route-guide] example.

To learn more about:

- [Asynchronous callback API][grpc-callback-api] and the [best practices][grpc-best-practices] about gRPC services.
- [Proto3 syntax][proto3-syntax] and the [best practices][protobuf-best-practices] about RPC messages.

This project shows the design and usages of the client-side implementation for applications using gRPC.
This project is based on gRPC library and provides an implementation to:

- send request and receive response messages ([unary reactor][client-unary-reactor])
- to connect to a stream and receives streamed response messages ([read reactor][client-read-reactor])

## Requirements

### C++ standard

This code requires C++20, so be sure the available C++ compiler has a good support of the C++20 features and libraries.
For details about the compilers: [C++20 compiler support][cpp20-support]

### Build tools

- C++ compiler (GCC 11 or above, Clang, ...)
- CMake

### Dependencies automatically solved by CMake

The following third-parties are fetched by CMake and compiled for the need of the project:

- [EventLoop][eventloop-lib] library which follows the state-of-the-art of eventloop mechanisms and its replacement with
  similar library or implementation should be easy.
- [gflags][gflags-lib] library for command-line arguments processing.
- [glaze][glaze-lib] library to handle the JSON database in a better way than the original code from the gRPC example.
- [spdlog][spdlog-lib] library for logging using the {fmt} style.

### External dependencies

- gRPC
- Protobuf, which is usually included through gRPC

Because downloading and compiling gRPC on project build is a long and annoying process, it is better instead to have
them already available through the OS system:

- **System installation**: Install via package manager or manual compilation (see
  [GRPC_BUILD_GUIDE.md](/GRPC_BUILD_GUIDE.md))
